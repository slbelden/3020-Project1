# 3020-Project1

Task:  
Write a linked-list implementation of self-adjusting lists. In a self-adjusting list, all insertions are performed at the front. A self-adjusting list adds a find operation, and when an element is accessed by a find, it is moved to the front of the list without changing the relative order of the other items.  
Demonstrate a case in which a self-adjusting container finds elements, on average, faster than a static container.

We apologize for the horrendous code duplication in main.cpp  
Please don't think that that is an acceptable way to write production code.

This project is closed. All code is unlicenced.
